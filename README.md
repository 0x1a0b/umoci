## `imagectl` ###

`imagectl` intends to be a complete manipulation tool for [OCI images][oci-image-spec].
In particular, it should be seen as a more end-user-focused version of the
[`oci-image-tools` provided by the OCI][oci-image-tools]. The hope is that all
of this tooling will eventually be merged with the upstream repository, so that
it is always kept up-to-date by the Open Container Initiative community.

However, currently there is a [lot][disc-1] [of][disc-2] [dicussion][disc-3]
about the new tooling going into the OCI image tools, and right now I need
tooling that can abstract all of the internals of the OCI specification into a
single CLI interface. The main purpose of this tool is to serve as example of
what **I** would like to see in an `oci-image` tool.
